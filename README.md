# MMDetection 3.0 Vector Extension English Guide

## Introduction
* MMDetection 3.0 Vector Extension is a deep learning framework developed based on [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) for vector detection. For each ROI point in an image, we aim to have a corresponding vector and output this correspondence.
* This project is mainly migrated and updated from [BONAI](https://github.com/jwwangchn/BONAI/) and provides detailed comments on important core code. Currently, the comments are in Chinese and will be updated to English later.

## How to Use?
* This project also depends on configuration files as well as training and testing datasets, so it cannot be run currently. The datasets will be uploaded to other repositories in the future.
* Additionally, please note that the complete documentation for this project has not yet been written. Most of the code is migrated from MMDetection, so please refer to the documentation of [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) first.
* For specific core code locations, you can directly view the [commit history](https://github.com/ChenpengZhang/mmdetection_vector_extension/commit/bab4e85815ac08b98cb711a6ee25cb2cb571184b). It includes information on core code changes, allowing you to review the model's specific logic and what components have been added.
